# Audio Tester
Audio tone and panning testing webapp by StewVed

Use it directly within GitHub at:
https://stewved.github.io/audiotester/

Featuring (experimental HTML5 standard) "Add to Homescreen" for
Android (chrome firefox browsers I think), and the ability to
play the game offline, like a native app.

Suggestions, tips/support, etc. welcome!
